# Why Open Source software is better


Copied from [Why is open source software more secure?](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2985242/open-source-tools/why-is-open-source-software-more-secure.html)

> ”Open source is not automatically more secure than closed source. The difference is with open source code you can verify for yourself (or pay someone to verify for you) whether the code is secure. With closed source programs you need to take it on faith that a piece of code works properly, open source allows the code to be tested and verified to work properly.
> 
> Open source also allows anyone to fix broken code, while closed source can only be fixed by the vendor.
> 
> Over time this means open source projects (like the Linux kernel) tend to become more secure people more people are testing and fixing the code.
> 
> Anyone who makes a general statement like "Open source software is more secure," is wrong. What they should say is, "Open source software can be audited and fixed when its behaviour or security is in doubt."
>
> Does anyone check the code? A lot of people do, especially on larger projects like Linux, the C library, Firefox, etc. Do I? Usually no, but I have done a few audits on code I was running to make sure it worked properly.
> 
> I usually don't trust Microsoft or Valve or any other closed source software. And I usually only really trust open source projects that have been proactive when it comes to security.”
