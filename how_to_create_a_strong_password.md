[Here's a list of 100 common bad passwords.](data_100_most_common_passwords_from_adobe_hack.md)


## Create a strong password

### Strategy 1: Pick a meaningful phrase

Pick a phrase that has a strong meaning for you but no one else would guess.

If you feel strongly about politics your password might be:

`Don't let Trump win in 2016!`

Or if [Dune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29) is your favorite book, you may select a passage, like:

`I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.`

Additionally it's recommended that you substitute numbers and symbols for some of the letters, like:

`I mu$t not fear. Fear is th3 mind-ki11er.`

### Strategy 2: Create an acronym

Take the first letter of each word and make it your password.

For example, take this passage from [The Conquest of Bread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conquest_of_Bread):

> All is for all! If the man and the woman bear their fair share of work, they have a right to their fair share of all that is produced by all, and that share is enough to secure them well-being.

Your password is: AifaItmatwbtfsowtharttfsoatipbaatsietstwb

This example is a bit long but you can probably think of a 15 word phrase from a favorite song, poem, book, etc and use it to make a password.


### Strategy 3: Use a random password generator

Search your favorite search engine for `strong password generator`

### Strategy 4: Diceware

The basic idea with [Diceware](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) is that you download a list of 7,000 short words from their site and then start rolling dice.  5 rolls is code for a specific word in the list, like `6 4 3 2 6 ==>> wok`

Go through this several times and you'll have a string of words like `wok clam far quit north`.  This is your new password and no one can re-create it.

### Strategy 5: Password card

[This site](http://www.passwordcard.org/) will create a bunch of random of passwords that you can print out on paper and store somewhere safe.
