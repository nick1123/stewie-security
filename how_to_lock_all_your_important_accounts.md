*Stewie, I have so many online accounts!  Which accounts should I lock down?*

It depends.  How much damage could someone do if they got into a specific account?  Keep in mind that damage extends far beyond money loss and may inlude damage to your reputation and your family's reputation.


*How to protect your important online accounts:*

* [Change your password to something no would ever guess](how_to_create_a_strong_password.md)
* Don't use the same password for anything else
* Enable 2-factor authentication (whenever available)
* Use a VPN in public places

Also, you may have a security vulnerability with shared accounts e.g. your spouse has a really poor password to the bank account you both share.


*Stewie, I have so many passwords.  How do I keep track of them all?*

Use a password manager.
