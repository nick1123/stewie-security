# Security Surety

*How to protect yourself online*

## Security Stages

You never be totally secure online. Rather there're a series of steps that you can take to become increasingly secure. The beginning steps are easy and taking just the first few steps can greatly increase you're security.

### Step 1:  Lock down your email account

Your email account holds the keys to the kingdom.  If a hacker gets access to your email account then can do serious damage. 

*A hacker can:*

* Click on "Forgot Password" for Twitter, Facebook, etc which well send a password reset email to your email account.  He can reset your social media passwords and post embarrassing nonsense. #ProjectMayhem
* With some social engineering and looking through the contents of your email account he might even be able to get access to your PayPal account, Amazon account, and bank account.  #FreeStuffForMe
* Looking through your email account and Facebook data he can probably find out your mother's maiden name, your birthday, previous street addresses, etc..  #IdentityTheft

*How hackers steal your email account password:*

* Public Wi-Fi sniffing combined with a man in the middle attack
* Dictionary attack or modified dictionary attack
* Phishing attack
* You use the same password on some-site.com and hackers gain access to that site and everyone's passwords

*How to protect your email account:*

* Change your password to something no would ever guess
* Don't use the same password for anything else
* Enable 2-factor authentication
* Use a VPN in public places




### Don't use Windows

> Securing an environment of Windows platforms from abuse - external or internal - is akin to trying to install sprinklers in a fireworks factory where smoking on the job is permitted.

Gene Spafford (in e-mail to organizers of a workshop on insider misuse)

### Technology is the answer

> Relying on the government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds.

John Perry Barlow

### Social Engineering

> Amateurs hack systems, professionals hack people.

Bruce Schneier

> People often represent the weakest link in the security chain and are chronically responsible for the failure of security systems. 

Bruce Schneier, Secrets and Lies

> Phishing is a major problem because there really is no patch for human stupidity

Mike Danseglio, program manager in the Security Solutions group at Microsoft, April 4, 2006

### Bio Metrics

> If someone steals your password, you can change it. But if someone steals your thumbprint, you canâ€™t get a new thumb. The failure modes are very different.

Bruce Schneier

### Going Forward

> The best way to get management excited about a disaster plan is to burn down the building across the street.

Dan Erwin, Security Officer, Dow Chemical Co.

> As we know,
> There are known knowns.
> There are things we know we know.
> We also know
> There are known unknowns.
> That is to say
> We know there are some things
> We do not know.
> But there are also unknown unknowns,
> The ones we don't know
> We don't know.

Donald Rumsfeld, February 12, 2002, Department of Defense news briefing
